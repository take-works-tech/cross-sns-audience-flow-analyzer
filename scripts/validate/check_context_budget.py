"""Instruction-context budget gate for cross-sns-audience-flow-analyzer.

The harness loads project memory into every turn. The generator measured this once, at the moment it
wrote the environment; **this gate measures it forever after**, which is the only version that helps.
An environment is small on the day it is generated and large two hundred days later, and nothing in
between charges it for the difference.

Two layers, two ceilings:

  ALWAYS      paid on every turn of every session
                - CLAUDE.md, **and whatever it pulls in with `@path` imports**
                - AGENTS.md, loaded once per session by the other agent runtime
                - .claude/rules/*.md WITHOUT `paths:` frontmatter
                - .claude/output-styles/*.md   (appended to the system prompt)
  CONDITIONAL paid only when a matching file is touched
                - .claude/rules/*.md WITH `paths:` frontmatter

A one-line `CLAUDE.md` reading `@AGENTS.md` is a common and sensible shape, and it is exactly where a
naive gate reads two tokens and reports a tiny always-layer while several thousand tokens load every
turn. Following the import is not a refinement; without it the number is wrong in the direction that
matters.

**Both are charged.** Charging only the first would make `paths:` a way to hide growth rather than a
trade: move a rule out of ALWAYS and the number falls, while the corpus the agent must eventually read
keeps growing. Path-scoping is a real decision with a real cost - a scoped rule does not reach a
subagent, and does not survive a compaction - so it is bounded rather than free.

Reported but not charged, because they are machine-local and absent on CI:
  CLAUDE.local.md, and any per-project auto-memory index.

Token estimate: tokens ~= ascii_chars / 4 + non_ascii_chars. Deliberately crude and deliberately
pessimistic for non-ASCII text; a gate that under-counts is a gate that passes the day it should not.

Exit code: 0 within budget, 1 over budget. Stdlib only.
