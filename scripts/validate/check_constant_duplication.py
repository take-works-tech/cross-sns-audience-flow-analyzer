"""Single-source-of-truth gate for constants in cross-sns-audience-flow-analyzer.

The same named constant defined in two files is the defect that produces the longest debugging
sessions in this kind of codebase, because nothing about it looks wrong. Both definitions are
correct-looking, both are reachable, and the day one of them is edited the other keeps serving the
old value to whoever imports it. Parity tests find this **after** it has diverged; this finds it when
the second definition is written.

Two shapes are reported, and both are the same defect at different stages:

  contradiction  the same name bound to different values in different files - already diverged
  copy           the same name bound to the same value in different files - diverging next week

What is scanned: module-level `UPPER_SNAKE = literal` in Python, and `const`/`export const`
`UPPER_SNAKE = literal` in TypeScript and JavaScript. Only literals, because a name bound to an
expression is usually a derivation rather than a second source, and a gate that cannot tell the
difference gets switched off.

**Exemptions are written here, in the open.** A name in EXEMPT is a decision somebody made and can be
read; a baseline file that accumulates silently is how a gate stops meaning anything.

Exit code: 0 clean, 1 duplicates found. Stdlib only.
